### Introduction:
Industrial production lines churn out products from raw materials all the time. But keeping these production lines running effectively is a quite challenging task.There are lots of processes running together which may invite manual errors. Industrial production lines have different process lines and need manual counting from time to time to track the product output which can then be passed to next department.

Manually counting the endless supply of products coming out is not possible for a human being. A human will inevitably loose track at a time. So here we develop an automatic product line counter system to automate this task. This system provides the following advantages:

•	Automated Tireless counting

•	Keep Count Data Stored as well as Display live count

•	No Error probability in counting
